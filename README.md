# Algorithms Implemented using OpenGL and Qt

Welcome to the "Algorithms Implemented using OpenGL and Qt" repository. This repository contains various projects that demonstrate the implementation of algorithms using the OpenGL graphics library and the Qt framework. Each algorithm is organized into separate folders for clarity.

## Projects

### 1. Solar Panel System

Folder: [Solar_System](Solar_System)

The `Solar Panel System` project showcases a simulation of a solar panel system revolving around a sun. It utilizes OpenGL and Qt for rendering.

### 2. B-Spline Curve Drawing

Folder: [BSpline](BSpline)

The BSpline Curve project provides a dynamic link library (DLL) for a 3D B-spline curve using OpenGL and Qt. It includes a `BSpline` class for creating and evaluating B-spline curves.

### 3. Bezier Curve Drawing

Folder: [Bezier](Bezier)

The Bezier Curve Drawing project demonstrates the drawing of Bezier curves using the Bezier algorithm. The `Bezier` class is responsible for creating and rendering Bezier curves.

### 4. Hermite Curve Drawing

Folder: [Hermite](Hermite)

The Hermite Curve Drawing project features the implementation of Hermite curves. The `Hermite` class is used to create and draw Hermite curves.

### 5. Geometry

Folder: [Geometry](Geometry)

The Geometry project includes implementations of fundamental geometric shapes such as points, lines, rectangles, and circles using OpenGL and Qt.

## Usage

Each project folder contains its respective source code, header files, and additional resources. Follow the instructions provided in each project's README file for building, running, and understanding the implementation details.
